Welcome to my fun game knowledge quiz about albion online. 
Below i list the steps i came up with in order to make this game possible. 

In Javascript I needed to create these items. 
// Need to make a timer
// Need to make a correct/ incorrect score
// Need to store local high scores
// incorrect answers need to affect the timer negatively
// put condition in if timer =0 game over
// need additional condition to end game if all questions are answered.
// Need to save initials to high score kept in local storage 
// Need start over or finish game at the end
// Need alert box to start quiz

For CSS to style it properly I created the listed below 
Need to created or borrow bootstrap css. I want to make easy flex boxes for the answers need to round off symmetric corners for each box.

HTML I need to create a nav bar for a link to high scores. I also need to include a time left in this as well. For the main body text i need to have replaceable objects that are called upon in Javascript to change out the different verbiage, text etc.
